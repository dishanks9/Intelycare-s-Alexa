# Intelycare-s-Alexa
Alexa skill for Intelycare's mobile application
This alexa skill was developed as a part of hackathon organized by Intelycare.
This skill was developed using Python and AWS Lambda.
There are sample utterances in the utterances.txt file which were used for this alexa skill.
The logical code for this skill is there in memorygame.py file. So whenever the user will the given utterances it will look for the function written for that intent in the memorygame.py file. Then it will execute the function and return the answer in the form of the template for that function in templates.yaml file.
In this way there were some of the functionalities of Intelycare application developed for this skill.
